# Implementing Cisco Networking Solutions
This is the code repository for [Implementing Cisco Networking Solutions](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/implementing-cisco-networking-solutions?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787121782), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Most enterprises use Cisco networking equipment to design and implement their networks. However, some networks outperform networks in other enterprises in terms of performance and meeting new business demands, because they were designed for the present while keeping the future in mind.

The book starts by describing the various stages in the network lifecycle and cover the plan, build, and operate phases. The book covers topics that will help network engineers capture requirements, choose the right technology, design and implement the network, and finally manage and operate the network. The book will divide the overall network into its constituents depending upon functionality, and describe the technologies used and the design considerations for each functional area. The areas covered in the book include the campus wired network, wireless access network, WAN choices, datacenter technologies, and security technologies. The book also discusses the need to identify business-critical applications on the network, and how to prioritize these applications by deploying Quality of Service on the network. Each topic provides the technology choices, and the scenario, involved in choosing each technology, and provides configuration guidelines for configuring and implementing solutions in enterprise networks.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter04.



The code will look like the following:
```
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
Router(config-if)# description To_Switch_Gig_0/1
Router(config-if)# ip addr 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# ip local-proxy arp
```

You will need an open mind and a lot of discussions with stakeholders to capture the user
requirements, after which the technologies and design choices in this book will help you
build a robust network. Most of the configurations shown in this book are for iOS release
15.
